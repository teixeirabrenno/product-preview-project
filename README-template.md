## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Really proud to be able to use grid effectively. Took me more time than I would like to admit to finish this challenge, but I'm really happy that I managed to do it. I also learned how to work with different images and media queries for better responsiveness.

### Continued development

I'll definitely continue to practice using grid for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive CSS Grid Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA) - This is probably the best video about CSS Grid on Youtube. It was really easy to understand.
